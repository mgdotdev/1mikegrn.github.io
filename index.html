						<h3>Teaching</h3>
						<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">
							I believe that potential is infinite. When it comes to my students, it
							doesn't matter where they come from, what class they were born into,
							what privilege they have or they lack. The goal is growth, plain and
							simple. And as a teacher, it's my job to be sure that not only are my
							students proficient in the material they are tasked to cover, but that
							they strive for the greatest of growth which they can manage. For some,
							growth is second nature. And for those students, the responsibility is
							to be sure that the requisite assistance and material is available for
							them to strive. For others, sometimes growth takes a bit of work. For
							these students, the responsibility I assume as their teacher is to go
							beyond the call of duty, and to work unremittingly with those who
							require the extra effort. This dichotomy I find is the great challenge
							when it comes to education - maintaining the standard that every
							individual student has an equality of opportunity for success, but
							recognizing the truth that sometimes support should be allocated to those who most
							need it. It is particularly difficult at the undergraduate level, when
							for these college students, so much of their path has already been
							defined. Nevertheless, our job as educators isn't to shy away from
							challenges which we find difficult. As President Roosevelt said, "credit
							belongs to the man who is actually in the arena... who knows great
							enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;
							who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and
							who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly..."
							This vision of daring greatly is the vision I bring to the classroom.
							And through my experience in the years which I have been teaching, great
							enthusiasms and great devotions, coupled with logical and intelligent
							approach, bring forth the goals which we dare greatly to realize.

							chemistry, where entire fields such as computational chemistry, materials
							informatics, augmented organic chemistry, et alia, now are inextricably
							intertwined with computer science. As such, it is imperative that

							work, I worked with the School of Medicine to teach the chemistry
							portions of their diversity outreach programs. It was an amazing
							opportunity to work with these middle and high school level kids who
							were so passionate about taking every opportunity to grow. Working with
							these students, showing them the chemistry of the world around us, the
							life inside us, and the materials which ground us, was a pleasure and an
